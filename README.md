## Environment Variables

You need to set the following environment variables for the project to work:

1. **SendGrid API Key**:  
   Set the SendGrid API Key to allow email sending.  

   For Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   export SENDGRID_API_KEY="your_sendgrid_api_key"
   ```

   For Windows (PowerShell):
   ```bash
   $env:SENDGRID_API_KEY="your_sendgrid_api_key"
   ```


2. **Groq API Key**:
Set the Groq API Key for API integrations.

   For Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
   ```
   For Windows:
   ```bash
   $env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
   ```

## How to Run
1. **Start the Celery Worker:**
   ```bash
   celery -A app worker --loglevel=info
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit Server:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## API Keys Setup

**How to Get SendGrid API Key:**

1. Sign up or log in at SendGrid.
2. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
3. Generate a new API key with ```Full Access```.
4. Copy the key and set it as the ```SENDGRID_API_KEY``` environment variable.

**Groq API Key:**

1. Visit Groq API and create an account.
2. Generate an API key.
3. Set it as the ```GROQ_API_KEY``` environment variable.

## Files Description
```app.py:```

- Core application file.
- Manages email generation, scheduling, and sending functionalities.

```schedule.py:```

- Contains Celery tasks for scheduling emails.

```requirements.txt:```

- Lists all dependencies required for the project.

## Dashboard
The dashboard provides the following functionalities:

- Email Analytics: View sent, pending, and failed emails.
- Recipient Management: See the list of recipients loaded from CSV.
- Log Viewer: Check the status of scheduled tasks.


## Troubleshooting
1. Environment Variable Errors:

- Ensure youâ€™ve set SENDGRID_API_KEY correctly.
- Restart your terminal after setting the variables.

2. Redis Connection Issue:

- Make sure Redis is installed and running.
- Verify the ```REDIS_URL```.

3. Celery Task Not Running:

- Check if Celery is correctly pointing to Redis.
- Restart the Celery worker with:
   ```bash
   celery -A app worker --loglevel=info
   ```

4. Streamlit Dashboard Not Launching:

- Verify Streamlit installation with pip list.
- Re-run the dashboard command.
